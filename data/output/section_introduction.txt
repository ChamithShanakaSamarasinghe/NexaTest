1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document provides a detailed description of the
functional and non-functional requirements of the Online Student Management System (OSMS). The
document is intended to serve as a reference for software developers, system architects, quality
assurance engineers, and researchers involved in requirement analysis and training-based system
modelling.
This SRS is also used as an input document for SRS segmentation and software feature extraction,
where requirements are analysed, classified, and prepared for training intelligent systems.
1.2 Scope
